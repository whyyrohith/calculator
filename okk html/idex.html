    <h1>THE FULL MOON</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>Here are some facts about full moons: 
        When it happens
        A full moon occurs when the moon is on the opposite side of Earth from the sun, and the side of the moon facing Earth is fully lit up by the sun. 
        How it happens
        The moon appears as a complete circle in the sky because the sun's rays illuminate the entire side of the moon facing Earth. The moon doesn't produce its own light, so we can only see the parts that are lit up by other sources. 
        How often it happens
        A full moon occurs about once a month, and is the midpoint of the lunar cycle, which lasts 29 days. </p>

<p>Other effects
    A full moon can cause maximum tides on Earth, which are the rising and falling of the oceans due to gravitational pulls. It can also cause gravitational effects on the atmosphere and Earth's interior. 
    Blue moons
    Sometimes two full moons occur in a calendar month, which is known as a blue moon. Blue moons happen every two and a half years. 
    Lunar eclipses
    A full moon is the only time when a lunar eclipse can occur, which happens when the moon passes into Earth's shadow. 
    Mythology
    Myths about werewolves and crazed behavior have developed around the full moon. 
    Naming
    Many cultures name each full moon of the year. </p>
